content: "**Physiological Benefits of Hypoxic Training\r**\n\nSimulated Altitude Training or Hypoxic Training (reduced oxygen training) accelerates the normal outcomes of exercise, as well as producing many additional benefits, thereby producing BETTER RESULTS, in LESS TIME, with LESS EFFORT.\r\n\nAltitude training has been used for many years by athletes across many sports to improve performance. Teams and individuals spend time and money having training camps in altitude environments across the world, but now with SynergAIR Hypoxic Training Systems you can utilise this powerful training tool to enhance your exercise experience. At sea level the air we breathe is roughly 21% oxygen, but as we simulate altitude environments, the amount of oxygen decreases as the altitude increases, requiring your cardiovascular system to work harder at any given workload. The lower oxygen concentration in altitude environment causes the body to be more efficient at using fuel and oxygen, and triggers a variety of physiological responses and changes in your body at a number of levels that improve metabolic efficiency.\n\n![gym](/images/uploads/lrg_dsc04838.jpg)\n\nAltitude training sessions can give you a great workout with much less stress on your body, or enhance the effectiveness of any workout you do and make your exercise more time efficient. Clients with limited exercise tolerance (e.g. can only walk) get more value from altitude training.\r\n\n**Altitude training enhances and accelerates the positive outcomes of exercise on:\r**\n\n\\- Fat Loss\r\n\n\\- Diabetes\r\n\n\\- Osteoporosis\r\n\n\\- Aerobic endurance and energy levels\r\n\n\\- Anaerobic fitness and lactic acid tolerance\r\n\n\\- Anaemia, due to increased red blood cells and haemoglobin\r\n\n\\- Testosterone and other blood hormone profiles\r\n\n\\- Cardiac surgery rehabilitation\r\n\n\\- Insomnia\r\n\n**Other potential benefits include:\r**\n\n\\- improved dexterity, co-ordination and cognitive decision making under stress and when fatigued.\r\n\n\\- enhanced collagen production, with improvements in wound healing, beauty treatment outcomes and skin elasticity.\n\n![test](/images/uploads/0y0a0635.jpg)\n\nHypoxic Training for Health, Beauty and Wellness\r\n\nInefficient oxygen utilisation accelerates aging, whilst efficient oxygen utilisation minimises the effects of aging on the body. Our bodies are in effect much like burning candles, or decaying fruit, but hypoxic training in a simulated altitude environment makes our bodies use oxygen more effectively, thereby slowing down the aging process and increasing the characteristics of youthfulness.\r\n\nHypoxic training in a simulated altitude training environment dramatically stimulates the bodyâ€™s metabolism and optimises hormonal and biochemical levels, resulting in significant changes in many health, beauty and wellness parameters.\r\n\nSimulated altitude training sessions allow you to workout with much less stress on your body, but at the same enhances the effectiveness of any workout, whilst triggering a wide variety of physiological responses and changes in your body.\r\n\nClinical research and empirical evidence suggest the following potential positive outcomes of low intensity hypoxic training in a simulated altitude training environment."
