      Simulated Altitude Training or Hypoxic Training (reduced oxygen training)
      accelerates the normal outcomes of exercise, as well as producing many
      additional benefits, thereby producing **BETTER RESULTS, in LESS TIME,
      with LESS EFFORT.**


      Altitude training has been used for many years by athletes across many
      sports to improve performance. Teams and individuals spend time and money
      having training camps in altitude environments across the world, but now
      with SynergAIR Hypoxic Training Systems you can utilise this
      powerfultraining tool to enhance your exercise experience. At sea level
      the air we breathe is roughly 21% oxygen, but as we simulate altitude
      environments, the amount of oxygen decreases as the altitude increases,
      requiring your cardiovascular system to work harder at any given workload.
      The lower oxygen concentration in altitude environment causes the body to
      be more efficient at using fuel and oxygen, and triggers a variety of
      physiological responses and changes in your body at a number of levels
      that improve metabolic efficiency.

      Altitude training sessions can give you a great workout with much less
      stress on your body, or enhance the effectiveness of any workout you do
      and make your exercise more time efficient. Clients with limited exercise
      tolerance (e.g. can only walk) get more value from altitude training.
      Altitude training enhances and accelerates the positive outcomes of
      exercise on:


      \- Fat Loss


      \- Diabetes


      \- Osteoporosis


      \- Aerobic endurance and energy levels-


      \- Anaerobic fitness and lactic acid tolerance


      \- Anaemia, due to increased red blood cells and haemoglobin


      \- Testosterone and other blood hormone profiles


      \- Cardiac surgery rehabilitation


      \- Insomnia

      **Other potential benefits include:**


      \- improved dexterity, co-ordination and cognitive decision making under
      stress and when fatigued.


      \- enhanced collagen production, with improvements in wound healing,
      beauty treatment outcomes and skin elasticity.


      Altitude training technology is currently used extensively by:


      \- Hospitals and beauty clinics to optimise the outcome for their patients
      and clients.


      \- The Australian Institute of Sport and many other world class institutes
      of sports


      \- Many professional sports teams such as Collingwood, Lions, St Kilda,
      Crows, Suns, Storm, Titans, South Sydney, Tigers and the Bulldogs.


      \- Elite sports people (including golfers and formula one drivers) seeking
      to improve co-ordination and performance under stress. Leading edge
      executives to enhance their performance, decision making, negotiating and
      cognitive abilities in stressful and demanding situations.

      Inefficient oxygen utilisation accelerates aging, whilst efficient oxygen
      utilisation minimises the effects of aging on the body. Our bodies are in
      effect much like burning candles, or decaying fruit, but hypoxic training
      in a simulated altitude environment makes our bodies use oxygen more
      effectively, thereby slowing down the aging process and increasing the
      characteristics of youthfulness.


      Hypoxic training in a simulated altitude training environment dramatically
      stimulates the bodyâ€™s metabolism and optimises hormonal and biochemical
      levels, resulting in significant changes in many health, beauty and
      wellness parameters.


      Simulated altitude training sessions allow you to workout with much less
      stress on your body, but at the same enhances the effectiveness of any
      workout, whilst triggering a wide variety of physiological responses and
      changes in your body.


      Clinical research and empirical evidence suggest the following potential
      positive outcomes of low intensity hypoxic training in a simulated
      altitude training environment.

      **WEIGHT LOSS**


      \- Accelerated fat loss


      \- Increased fat burning aerobic enzymes and mitochondria


      \- Boosts resting metabolic rate for days after your hypoxic workout


      \- Powerful stimulant effect of the hormone EPO


      \- Reduced appetite and increased leptin hormone levels


      \- Improved insulin and glucose sensitivity and decreased diabetes
      symptoms


      \- Increased growth hormone production (the bodies most powerful fat
      burning hormone)


      **BEAUTY ENHANCEMENTS**


      \- Improved skin elasticity, tone and appearance


      \- Reduction of skin wrinkles


      \- Increased collagen production

      **ENHANCED MOOD and BRAIN/CNS FUNCTION**


      \- Improved decision making, cognitive function, dexterity, co-ordination
      and reaction time under stress and when fatigued


      \- Increased serotonin production and serotonin receptor activation


      \- Combats depression and anxiety


      \- Stabilisation of emotional composure


      \- Combats insomnia and improves sleep


      \- Excites neural plasticity and facilitates positive re-wiring of the
      brain and central nervous system (CNS).


      \- Promotes spinal cord injury rehabilitation


      \- Endorphin production dramatically increased.


      \- Enhanced sense of wellbeing and vitality
