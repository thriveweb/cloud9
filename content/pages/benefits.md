      Simulated Altitude Training or Hypoxic Training (reduced oxygen training)
      accelerates the normal outcomes of exercise, as well as producing many
      additional benefits, thereby producing **BETTER RESULTS, in LESS TIME,
      with LESS EFFORT.**


      Altitude training has been used for many years by athletes across many
      sports to improve performance. Teams and individuals spend time and money
      having training camps in altitude environments across the world, but now
      with SynergAIR Hypoxic Training Systems you can utilise this
      powerfultraining tool to enhance your exercise experience. At sea level
      the air we breathe is roughly 21% oxygen, but as we simulate altitude
      environments, the amount of oxygen decreases as the altitude increases,
      requiring your cardiovascular system to work harder at any given workload.
      The lower oxygen concentration in altitude environment causes the body to
      be more efficient at using fuel and oxygen, and triggers a variety of
      physiological responses and changes in your body at a number of levels
      that improve metabolic efficiency.

      Altitude training sessions can give you a great workout with much less
      stress on your body, or enhance the effectiveness of any workout you do
      and make your exercise more time efficient. Clients with limited exercise
      tolerance (e.g. can only walk) get more value from altitude training.
      Altitude training enhances and accelerates the positive outcomes of
      exercise on:


      *  Fat Loss

      * Diabetes

      * Osteoporosis

      * Aerobic endurance and energy levels

      * Anaerobic fitness and lactic acid tolerance

      * Anaemia, due to increased red blood cells and haemoglobin

      * Testosterone and other blood hormone profiles

      * Cardiac surgery rehabilitation

      * Insomnia
