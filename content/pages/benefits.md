      Simulated Altitude Training or Hypoxic Training (reduced oxygen training)
      accelerates the normal outcomes of exercise, as well as producing many
      additional benefits, thereby producing **BETTER RESULTS, in LESS TIME,
      with LESS EFFORT**. 


      Altitude training has been used for many years by athletes across many
      sports to improve performance. Teams and individuals spend time and money
      having training camps in altitude environments across the world, but now
      with SynergAIR Hypoxic Training Systems you can utilise this powerful
      training tool to enhance your exercise experience. At sea level the air we
      breathe is roughly 21% oxygen, but as we simulate altitude environments,
      the amount of oxygen decreases as the altitude increases, requiring your
      cardiovascular system to work harder at any given workload. The lower
      oxygen concentration in altitude environment causes the body to be more
      efficient at using fuel and oxygen, and triggers a variety of
      physiological responses and changes in your body at a number of levels
      that improve metabolic efficiency.

    listText: "Altitude training sessions can give you a great workout with much less stress on your body, or enhance the effectiveness of any workout you do and make your exercise more time efficient. Clients with limited exercise tolerance (e.g. can only walk) get more value from altitude training.\r\n\nAltitude training enhances and accelerates the positive outcomes of exercise on:\r\n\n\\- Fat Loss\r\n\n\\- Diabetes\r\n\n\\- Osteoporosis\r\n\n\\- Aerobic endurance and energy levels\r\n\n\\- Anaerobic fitness and lactic acid tolerance\r\n\n\\- Anaemia, due to increased red blood cells and haemoglobin\r\n\n\\- Testosterone and other blood hormone profiles\r\n\n\\- Cardiac surgery rehabilitation\r\n\n\\- Insomnia"

    listText: "**Other potential benefits include:\r**\n\n\\- improved dexterity, co-ordination and cognitive decision making under stress and when fatigued.\r\n\n\\- enhanced collagen production, with improvements in wound healing, beauty treatment outcomes and skin elasticity.\r\n\nAltitude training technology is currently used extensively by:\r\n\n\\- Hospitals and beauty clinics to optimise the outcome for their patients and clients.\r\n\n\\- The Australian Institute of Sport and many other world class institutes of sports\r\n\n\\- Many professional sports teams such as Collingwood, Lions, St Kilda, Crows, Suns, Storm, Titans, South Sydney, Tigers and the Bulldogs.\r\n\n\\- Elite sports people (including golfers and formula one drivers) seeking to improve co-ordination and performance under stress. Leading edge executives to enhance their performance, decision making, negotiating and cognitive abilities in stressful and demanding situations."

    listText: "Inefficient oxygen utilisation accelerates aging, whilst efficient oxygen utilisation minimises the effects of aging on the body. Our bodies are in effect much like burning candles, or decaying fruit, but hypoxic training in a simulated altitude environment makes our bodies use oxygen more effectively, thereby slowing down the aging process and increasing the characteristics of youthfulness.\r\n\nHypoxic training in a simulated altitude training environment dramatically stimulates the bodyâ€™s metabolism and optimises hormonal and biochemical levels, resulting in significant changes in many health, beauty and wellness parameters.\r\n\nSimulated altitude training sessions allow you to workout with much less stress on your body, but at the same enhances the effectiveness of any workout, whilst triggering a wide variety of physiological responses and changes in your body.\r\n\nClinical research and empirical evidence suggest the following potential positive outcomes of low intensity hypoxic training in a simulated altitude training environment."
