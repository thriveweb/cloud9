Teams and individuals spend time and money having training camps in altitude environments across the world, but now with SynergAIR Hypoxic Training Systems you can utilise this powerful training tool to enhance your exercise experience. At sea level the air we breathe is roughly 21% oxygen, but as we simulate altitude environments, the amount of oxygen decreases as the altitude increases, requiring your cardiovascular system to work harder at any given workload. The lower oxygen concentration in altitude environment causes the body to be more efficient at using fuel and oxygen, and triggers a variety of physiological responses and changes in your body at a number of levels that improve metabolic efficiency. \n\nAltitude training sessions can give you a great workout with much less stress on your body, or enhance the effectiveness of any workout you do and make your exercise more time efficient. Clients with limited exercise tolerance (e.g. can only walk) get more value from altitude training.\n\n**Altitude training enhances and accelerates the positive outcomes of exercise on:    **\n\n\\-\tFat Loss\n\n\\-\tDiabetes\n\n\\-\tOsteoporosis\n\n\\-\tAerobic endurance and energy levels\n\n\\-\tAnaerobic fitness and lactic acid tolerance\n\n\\-\tAnaemia, due to increased red blood cells and haemoglobin\n\n\\-\tTestosterone and other blood hormone profiles\n\n\\-\tCardiac surgery rehabilitation\n\n\\-\tInsomnia\n\n\n\n**Other potential benefits include:\n**-\timproved dexterity, co-ordination and cognitive decision making under stress and when fatigued.\n\n\\-\tenhanced collagen production, with improvements in wound healing, beauty treatment outcomes and skin elasticity.\n\nAltitude training technology is currently used extensively by:\n\n\\-\tHospitals and beauty clinics to optimise the outcome for their patients and clients.\n\n\\-\tThe Australian Institute of Sport and many other world class institutes of sports\n\n\\-\tMany professional sports teams such as Collingwood, Lions, St Kilda, Crows, Suns, Storm, Titans, South Sydney, Tigers and the Bulldogs.\n\n\\-\tElite sports people (including golfers and formula one drivers) seeking to improve co-ordination and performance under stress. Leading edge executives to enhance their performance, decision making, negotiating and cognitive abilities in stressful and demanding situations.\n\n\n\n**Hypoxic Training for Health, Beauty and Wellness\n**Inefficient oxygen utilisation accelerates aging, whilst efficient oxygen utilisation minimises the effects of aging on the body. Our bodies are in effect much like burning candles, or decaying fruit, but hypoxic training in a simulated altitude environment makes our bodies use oxygen more effectively, thereby slowing down the aging process and increasing the characteristics of youthfulness. \n\nHypoxic training in a simulated altitude training environment dramatically stimulates the bodyâ€™s metabolism and optimises hormonal and biochemical levels, resulting in significant changes in many health, beauty and wellness parameters. \n\nSimulated altitude training sessions allow you to workout with much less stress on your body, but at the same enhances the effectiveness of any workout, whilst triggering a wide variety of physiological responses and changes in your body. \n\nClinical research and empirical evidence suggest the following potential positive outcomes of low intensity hypoxic training in a simulated altitude training environment.\n\n\n\n**WEIGHT LOSS\n**-          Accelerated fat loss\n\n\\-          Increased fat burning aerobic enzymes and mitochondria\n\n\\-          Boosts resting metabolic rate for days after your hypoxic workout\n\n\\-          Powerful stimulant effect of the hormone EPO\n\n\\-          Reduced appetite and increased leptin hormone levels\n\n\\-          Improved insulin and glucose sensitivity and decreased diabetes symptoms\n\n\\-          Increased growth hormone production (the bodies most powerful fat burning hormone)\n\n\n\n**BEAUTY ENHANCEMENTS\n**-          Improved skin elasticity, tone and appearance \n\n\\-          Reduction of skin wrinkles \n\n\\-          Increased collagen production\n\n\\-          Accelerated wound healing\n\n\\-          Greater skin micro-circulation\n\n\\-          Dramatically faster recovery from plastic surgery, with superior outcomes\n\n\\-          Enhanced beauty treatment outcomes\n\n\n\n**ENHANCED MOOD and BRAIN/CNS FUNCTION\n**-          Improved decision making, cognitive function, dexterity, co-ordination and reaction time under stress and when fatigued\n\n\\-          Increased serotonin production and serotonin receptor activation\n\n\\-          Combats depression and anxiety\n\n\\-          Stabilisation of emotional composure\n\n\\-          Combats insomnia and improves sleep\n\n\\-          Excites neural plasticity and facilitates positive re-wiring of the brain and central nervous system (CNS). \n\n\\-          Promotes spinal cord injury rehabilitation\n\n\\-          Endorphin production dramatically increased. \n\n\\-          Enhanced sense of wellbeing and vitality\n\n\n\n**Accelerated positive outcomes of exercise on:\n**-          Osteoporosis\n\n\\-          Hormone profiles \n\n\\-          Cholesterol\n\n\\-          Blood pressure\n\n\\-          Asthma and pulmonary/lung conditions (including faster rehabilitation after giving up smoking)\n\n\\-          Immune function\n\n\\-          Muscle tone\n\n\\-          Recovery from surgery (especially cardiac surgery)\n\n\\-          Reduce side effects of chemotherapy and radiation treatments\n\n\\-          Sexual health"
