    listText: >-
      Simulated Altitude Training or Hypoxic Training (reduced oxygen
      training) accelerates the normal outcomes of exercise, as well as
      producing many additional benefits, thereby producing BETTER
      RESULTS, in LESS TIME, with LESS EFFORT. Altitude training has
      been used for many years by athletes across many sports to improve
      performance. Teams and individuals spend time and money having
      training camps in altitude environments across the world, but now
      with SynergAIR Hypoxic Training Systems you can utilise this
      powerful training tool to enhance your exercise experience. At sea
      level the air we breathe is roughly 21% oxygen, but as we simulate
      altitude environments, the amount of oxygen decreases as the
      altitude increases, requiring your cardiovascular system to work
      harder at any given workload. The lower oxygen concentration in
      altitude environment causes the body to be more efficient at using
      fuel and oxygen, and triggers a variety of physiological responses
      and changes in your body at a number of levels that improve
      metabolic efficiency.
